Storage provides 2 ways to you to store your data -- local disk and database.

## How to configure them

### Local Disk
Your data will be stored in a hidden file called .html which will be created in where programe running.  
You can still input the path you want to store in Settings.  

```python
from toapi import Api, Settings


class MySettings(Setting):
    '''your own settings'''

    storage = {
        "PATH": "/Users/username/toapi",
        "DB_URL": None
    }  
```
Sytem will load your path, and create a hidden file -- .html under your path: /Users/username/toapi/.html, and every site will be stored here.

### Database
You need a database to save your import data and make it read faster.  
To use database, you have to configure it first.

```python
from toapi import Api, Settings


class MySettings(Setting):
    '''your own settings'''

    storage = {
        "PATH": "/Users/username/toapi",
        "DB_URL": "sqlite:////User/username/toapi/data.sqlite"
    }
```
warning: if you configure PATH and DB_URL both, system will use database only!


## How to use storage

```python
from storage import Storage
from api import Settings

store = Storage(Settings)
url = "www.toapi.org"
